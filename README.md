# Introduction

This is a custom-developed WordPress theme based on TwentySixteen.

## Homepage Video

The homepage video is chosen on the clientâ€™s side from several pre-generated sources based on the height of the container (`header.site-header`).

The dark gradient at the top should be rendered into the video.

To come up with a list of frame sizes to create new videos, measure the height of `.site-header` while changing the viewport width.

There are currently four static heights for `.site-header`, though I also created a 1920px-wide video for viewports >= 1600px.

Each framesize should be wide enough to cover the entire range of viewport widths for that given height.

Take a look at the [video source files](https://github.com/ambassador-baptist-college/abc-theme/tree/master/video) to help understand how the system works.

The low-mo bitrate refers to a low-motion version of the video (basically still images fading into each other) for site visitors who have `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled. (See [this article](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/) for an introduction to the reduced motion media query.)

| Viewport Width | Container Height | Framesize |  Bitrate | Low-mo bitrate |
